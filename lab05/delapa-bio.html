        <h1>Lang Delapa's Biography</h1>

       <p>My name is Lang Delapa, and I’m a sophomore studying <strong>Advertising.</strong> Within Advertising, I want to have a creative role designing and coming up with ideas for ads, so I have added an iSchool minor in hopes of learning web design. </p>
       
       <p>Some of my skills include drawing, painting, photography, writing, and using Adobe software such as Premiere and Illustrator. As well as helping me in my future career, these skills translate into my personal life out of school as well. </p>
       
       <h2>Personal Information: </h2>
       <p>I’m also interested in reading, fashion, and, of course, hanging out with my friends. Besides web design, some of my favorite subject areas include languages and literature. Though I have never considered myself a “technology” person, I’m really excited to take this course. I’ve tried to learn HTML in the past but never got past the basics before forgetting about it, so I’m glad to have the course guiding me this year. </p>

        <h2>Books I've Read Recently:</h2>
        <p>I was a huge reader as a kid, and although I still enjoy it, it's a lot harder to do so when
         I'm constantly distracted by my phone, schoolwork, and friends. Recently, however, I've been putting in a lot more effort to read on a steady basis (though being at school is breaking the habit a bit), and I've read more this summer than I did in all of 2020.</p>
