        <h1>DAYTIME</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Planning an outfit to hang out with friends during the day can be a complicated task. Though I have more time to get ready, there is a lot more to think about if we aren’t just hanging out in someone’s dorm. Usually, we take pictures wherever we go, so it’s important that my outfit matches the vibe of where we’re going, and it’s an outfit that hasn’t recently been featured on my Instagram. Occasions range from a brunch, a cute picnic, a day in the city, thrifting, and more. These occasions give me the most freedom to show off my own fashion style</h2>

            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Lang and I'm a sophomore studying Advertising at Syracuse University. I'm passionate about style and would love to work somewhere in the fashion industry one day. Most of my clothes are thrifted, but I love stores like Urban Outfitters, Princess Polly, Motel Rocks, and my friends' closets.</p>
