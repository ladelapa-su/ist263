        <h1>NIGHTTIME</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Nighttime outfits tend to be a little “riskier” than daytime outfits—think darker colors, fabrics like leather and velvet, and high heels. I don’t wear anything too extreme, but there is definitely a hard line between what I would wear for a 1pm lunch vs. an 8pm dinner. These outfits are what I would wear to go to a late dinner, a bar (well, once I can get in at least!), a lounge, a party, or other nighttime occasions.</h2>

            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Lang and I'm a sophomore studying Advertising at Syracuse University. I'm passionate about style and would love to work somewhere in the fashion industry one day. Most of my clothes are thrifted, but I love stores like Urban Outfitters, Princess Polly, Motel Rocks, and my friends' closets.</p>
