        <h2>Crafting the perfect gameday outfit is more than throwing on a Syracuse t-shirt and calling it a day. I like mixing my own style with Syracuse-themed clothing to avoid looking straight out of the school store catalogue.</h2>

            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Lang and I'm a sophomore studying Advertising at Syracuse University. I'm passionate about style and would love to work somewhere in the fashion industry one day. Most of my clothes are thrifted, but I love stores like Urban Outfitters, Princess Polly, Motel Rocks, and my friends' closets.</p>
