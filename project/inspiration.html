            <h2>INSPO</h2>
            <p>I haven’t loved fashion forever. In fact, when I was a kid, I hated it. As I’ve grown up, I’ve gained so much fashion inspiration from sites like Pinterest, from fashion Youtubers and bloggers, and of course, just looking at what people around me are wearing. Here are some influencers that have, well, influenced my style.</p>

                <h3>Best Dressed (Ashley)</h3>
                <p>I was obsessed with this video and tried to copy all the outfits. Though my style has changed, this video was a changing point for my style. I still keep up with this Youtuber's fashion on Instagram.</p>

                <h2>ur mom ashley</h2>
                <p>Wow, another half-Asian fashion Youtuber named Ashley! I used to watch her clothing hauls religiously. She got me really into thrifting.</p>

            <h2>WISHLIST</h2>
            <p>I’m always looking to expand my closet, but being extremely indecisive, I can find it hard to actually make a purchase, since I’m always wondering if it’s worth it. Before actually buying anything, I have to weigh all my options—here are a few of them.</p>
